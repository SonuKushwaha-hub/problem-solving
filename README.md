## What this repository is about
This repository is created to organize the solutions of problems related to data structures and algorithms. And if possible, provide an easier way for learning various concepts related to data structures and algorithms.

### Topics covered till now (Alphabetically)
 - [Ad Hoc](ad_hoc/)
 - [Amortized Analysis](amortized_analysis/)
 - [Brute Force](brute_force/)
 - [Computational Geometry](computational_geometry/)
 - [Data Structure](data_structure/)
 - [Dynamic Programming](dynamic_programming/)
 - [Game](game/)
 - [Graph](graph/)
 - [Greedy](greedy/)
 - [Hashing](hashing/)
 - [Math](math/)
 - [Non-Overlapping Subproblem](non_overlapping_subproblem/)
 - [Search](search/)
 - [String](string/)

Each topic is divided into numerous subtopics, such as you'd find `list`, `stack`, `priority_queue`, `segment_tree`, `treap`, `link_cut_tree` etc. under `data_structure` category. We encourage you add more topic in this list.

### Languages used (till now)
 - C
 - C++
 - Java
 - PHP
 - Python
 - Ruby
 - JavaScript(NodeJS)
 - Racket(Formerly known as `PLT Sceme`)

This languages have been used till now. But we always welcome more new languages whether it is `C#`, `Bash` or `Brainfuck`. We welcome each and every computer language that exists in this universe.
